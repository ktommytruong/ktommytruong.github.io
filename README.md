# About Me
ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Tommy.

For the last 6-months, I have been self-studying data analytics in order to make a career switch from sales. During that time, I've learned Microsoft Excel, SQL, and Tableau. Below, you will find projects that I've completed using these programs. 

Aside from studying, I enjoy running/lifting weights, going on hikes, and trying new foods! 

# [Project 1: Adidas Sales Dashboard](https://github.com/ktommytruong/Adidas-Sales-Dashboard-Project)

This is a guided project that I completed by following along [Andy Kriebel's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w4s_6r3B6A&ab_channel=AndyKriebel) youtube tutorial on how to build a tableau dashboard. My personal objective for this project was to gain first hand experience on utilizing Tableau for data visualization. For this project, I used the Adidas sales data from Kaggle. The link to the dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vishwas199728/adidas-sales-data).
