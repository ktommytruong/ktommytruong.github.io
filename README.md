# Adidas-Sales-Dashboard-Project
This is a guided project that I completed by following along [Andy Kriebel's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w4s_6r3B6A&ab_channel=AndyKriebel) youtube tutorial on how to build a tableau dashboard. My personal objective for this project was to gain first hand experience on utilizing Tableau for data visualization. For this project, I used the Adidas sales data from Kaggle. The link to the dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vishwas199728/adidas-sales-data).
## Project Overview
- Use Tableau to create data visualizations 
- Analyze key insights from sales data
## Objectives
Create an interactive dashboard to better understand:
- Sales over time
- Sales by retailer
- Effective sales method
- Regional sales analysis
## Visualizations
The dashboard is available [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/tommy.truong/viz/AdidasSalesDashboard_16966298574710/Dashboard1)
- Within the dashboard you can filter by product category, region, and year
## Conclusions
- From December 2019 sales have grown from $16,253,746 to $74,214,623 **(a difference of $57,960,877)**
- Out of 6 retailers, West Gear had the highest number of sales with $243.0M compared to Amazon with only $64.3M **(a difference of $178.7M)**
- Between the three sales method: (in-store, online, outlet) in-store sales yielded the best-result with sales of $357M compared to the lowest method which was online with $247M **(a difference of $110M)**
- New York, California, Florida, and Texas have the highest number of sales by state compared to every other state
## Takeaways 
As someone who has never used Tableau, this was a great project to learn and follow along with. From this project I learned that, design is equally important as the visualizations themselves. Size, spacing, color, and readability can greatly impact the way we comprehend dashboards.
